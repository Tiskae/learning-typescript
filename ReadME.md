**This is a demo project I used for learning TypeScript basics**

Lessons learnt include:

- **Why TypeScript?** - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and adds typing to it. It is a development tool that makes developers write cleaner code and potentially catch errors and correct them right in their code editor.
- **Types** - include "string", "number", "Array", "Object", "Date", all classes and constructor functions, interfaces and other built in types. They define the structure of data and ensures that data types are not used incorrectly.
- **Generic Type**: is a type that combines or relate two types togther e.g. "number[ ]" or "Array `<number>`" to represent an array full of numbers only. It is also used in promises to define the type of its return type e.g. "new Pomise `<string> ((resolve, reject) => { ... })`" to define a Promise that returns a string.
- **Union Type**: is a type that combines two or more types together. Syntax : "string" | "number".
- **Type Alias**: stores the structure of a type for the sake of reusability e.g type NumOrString = "number" | "string".
- **Interfaces**: defines a custom type, useful for constructing more detailed structues especially for objects.

Proceeding to advanced topics ..

Thank you :)
